# NTUST-network  
a application which can get and compute the internet usage in NTUST dormitory  
made by Binssin  
  
only work in the win10 computer which is connect to the dromitory internet  
I'm not sure wireless connection can also  
but I can sure that computer with win10 and ethernet can use this application  
It will download a chromedriver in the NTUST network file path  
and... this application is safe  
so I public the code for everyone to check  
  
Finally, Have a good day~!
